# **Doom**

## **Goal for this project** 

The goal for this project is to create an interactive quiz site that is themed around the 1993 Doom game. 
The site is designed to be fully responsive, accessible and styled as close as possible to the original game.

### **Design Choices**

#### **Fonts** 
* To stick to the Doom theme I opted to use the Amazdoom font by Amazingmax fonts and Space Marine by Pixel Kitchen which I downloaded from [fontspace](https://www.fontspace.com/category/doom).
* I used the @fontface rule and used a [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_fonts.asp) lesson to guide me.
* For the gradient effect I used code from [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/blog/css-gradient-text/)

## **Wireframes**

I used Balsamic to create the wireframes for this site. First I started witha basic wireframe for the mobile and scaled up to the desktop. This site will only consist of one page and I've decided to aim for a more minimilistic design so as not to complicate the game. The game will be easier to play with this design as users will have the game right in front of them immediately.
